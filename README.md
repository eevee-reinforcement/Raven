# Raven
Raven addresses the need for a lightweight, anonymous chat solution for events, parties, or meetings. Unlike complex platforms like Slack and Discord, which are overwhelming for short-lived communication, Raven offers a temporary and simple chat server that can be accessed via a unique URL or QR code. Designed for short-term use, Raven provides expiration options such as one hour, one day, or one week.

# Core Features
Anonymous user registration with optional profile pictures.
QR code generation for event-specific chat servers.
General threads for group chats.
Event creator tools for managing chat visibility and expiration periods.
